# Micro SD Cards

The main purpose of this plugin is to help organize MicroSD cards for the SteamDeck. As such, the cards themselves are the most important aspect of MicroSDeck.

## Game Management and Tracking

All game management happens through the Steam UI. MicroSDeck simply tracks changes to games saved on each MicroSD card so you can view them even when the card isn't currently inserted. You can view all games on each MicroSD card that has been used, and also see which MicroSD card(s) a particular game is installed on.

## Card Identification and Naming

Identifying your MicroSD cards is crucial for using MicroSDeck effectively. MicroSDeck lets you name each card with full emoji support to uniquely identify it and hint at its contents. The name is just text, so any naming scheme works - as long as you can tell your cards apart.

Some examples of naming schemes are:
- Using the vendor name (e.g Sandisk, Samsung, ADATA)
- Using small stickers or pens to mark the cards
- Using numbered or lettered cases to identify the cards

But you can get as creative as you want. As long as you know which physical card belongs to which digital name.

## Registering a Card

To register a MicroSD card with MicroSDeck, it simply needs to be formatted by Steam and inserted. To format the MicroSD card, navigate to the Settings menu and click Format under `System > SystemSettings > Format SD Card`. It can take some time to format the MicroSD card, so be patient. If it still doesn't work, try unplugging and replugging the MicroSD card **after** Steam has finished formatting it.

Then all that is required is to install a game onto the MicroSD card through the Steam Library. MicroSDeck will automatically detect the game installation and associate it with the card.
