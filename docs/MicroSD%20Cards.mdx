# Micro SD Cards

The main purpose of this plugin is to help organize MicroSD cards for the Steamdeck. As such the cards themselves are the biggest aspect of MicroSDeck.

## Game Management and Tracking

All the management of steam games happens via the Steam UI, MicroSDeck just tracks all changes to the games saved on the MicroSD card to display when they are not currently plugged in. Not only are you able to view all games on each MicroSD card that has been inserted but it also displays which MicroSD card(s) a particular game is installed on.

## Card Identification and Naming

As such the identification of MicroSD cards is a crucial part of effectively using MicroSDeck to its fullest. MicroSDeck lets you name each card with full emoji support to best uniquely identify it, and hint at what it contains. And the name is a just text, any number of naming schemes can be used. As long as you are able to tell them apart the sky is the limit.

Some examples of naming schemes are:
- Using the vendor name (e.g Sandisk, Samsung, ADATA)
- Using small stickers or pens to mark the cards
- Using numbered or lettered cases to identify the cards

But you can get as creative as you want. As long as you know which physical card belongs to which digital name.

## Registering a Card

To Register a MicroSD card with MicroSDeck it simply has to be formatted by Steam and inserted. To Format the MicroSD card navigate into the Settings menu and click Format under `System > SystemSettings > Format SD Card`. It can take some time to format the MicroSD Card. Be patient. If it still doesn't work, try unplugging and replugging the MicroSD card **After** Steam has finished formatting it.
