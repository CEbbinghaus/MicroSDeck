# Quick Start

Here is a little checklist you can use to get you started with MicroSDeck

<CheckList>
	<CheckListItem title="Registered a Card" check={(cardsAndGames) => cardsAndGames.length > 0}>
		To Register a MicroSD card with MicroSDeck it simply has to be formatted by Steam and inserted.

		To Format the MicroSD card navigate into the <FaGear/> <button onClick={() => Navigation.OpenMainMenu()}>Settings</button> menu and click Format under `System > SystemSettings > Format SD Card`.

		> ℹ️ **Note:**
		> It can take some time to format the MicroSD Card. Be patient.
		> If it still doesn't work, try unplugging and replugging the MicroSD card **After** Steam has finished formatting it.

	</CheckListItem>
	<CheckListItem title="Installed a Game" check={(cardsAndGames) => cardsAndGames.filter(([_, games]) => games.length > 0).length > 0}>
		Now that you have your MicroSD Card registered with MicroSDeck its time to install a game to it. 
		
		For this simply Head on over to your <IoGridSharp/> <button onClick={() => Navigation.NavigateToLibraryTab()}>Library</button> and install any game. Make sure to install it to the MicroSD Card and not the Internal Drive.

		MicroSDeck should automatically pick up on the game after it has finished installing. This can take a few seconds...
	</CheckListItem>
	<CheckListItem title="Named a Card" check={(cardsAndGames) => cardsAndGames.filter(([card]) => card.name != "").length > 0}>
		Wonderful, Now that you have both Registered a MicroSD Card and Installed a game on it, it is now time to name the card. This aids in quickly finding the Card that you have installed the specified game to.

		For this just open the <button onClick={() => Navigation.OpenSideMenu(SideMenu.QuickAccess)}>Quick Access</button> menu (the `...` button on the right hand side of the steamdeck) and navigate to the MicroSDeck Plugin by tabbing down to the <FaPlug/> Decky Plugins section. Under the plugin list you should find MicroSDeck.

		Here are listed the Cards that are registered with MicroSDeck. You can rename any of them by clicking the `...` button and hitting **Edit** in the popup. 

		Giving your MicroSD card a meaningful name is half the battle. Try and come up with a system to easily label your cards. Some examples are:

		* With many different MicroSD card vendors it might be possible to just use the vendor name (e.g Sandisk, Samsung, ADATA)
		* Using small stickers (they have to be very thin) or Using pens, Little icons can be applied to the SD Cards (Emoji names are supported in MicroSDeck)
		* Some MicroSD card cases are numbered or lettered allowing you identify the cards theycontain

		But you can get as creative as you want. As long as you know which physical card belongs to which digital name.
	</CheckListItem>
	<CheckListItem title="Added Non Steam Game"check={(cardsAndGames) => cardsAndGames.filter(([_, games]) => games.filter(v => !v.is_steam).length > 0).length > 0}>
		The last step is to add a Non-Steam Game. This is also achieved via the same popup menu as renaming a card.

		Under the TextBox to set the card name there is a dropdown to allow toggling which Non-Steam Games should be considered "installed" on this card. 
	</CheckListItem>
